#3-5. Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the
#dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of
#someone else to invite.
#• Start with your program from Exercise 3-4. Add a print statement at the
#end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
#• Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with
#the name of the new person you are inviting.
#• Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still
#in your list.

guest_unable = "sanket"
print(f"\nUnfortunately, {guest_unable} can't make it to the dinner.")

#replace guest
guest_list.remove(guest_unable)
guest_list.append("simran")
