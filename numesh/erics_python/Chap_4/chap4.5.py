#4-5. Summing a Million: Make a list of the numbers from one to one million,
#and then use min() and max() to make sure your list actually starts at one and
#ends at one million. Also, use the sum() function to see how quickly Python can
#add a million numbers.

numbers=list(range(1,1000001))

print("The minimum number is:",min(numbers))
print("The maximum number is:",max(numbers))
print("The sum of number is:",sum(numbers))
