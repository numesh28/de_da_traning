#9-14. Dice: The module random contains functions that generate random numbers
#in a variety of ways. The function randint() returns an integer in the
#range you provide. The following code returns a number between 1 and 6:
#from random import randint
#x = randint(1, 6)
#Make a class Die with one attribute called sides, which has a default
#value of 6. Write a method called roll_die() that prints a random number
#between 1 and the number of sides the die has. Make a 6-sided die and roll
#it 10 times.
#Make a 10-sided die and a 20-sided die. Roll each die 10 times.

from random import randint
