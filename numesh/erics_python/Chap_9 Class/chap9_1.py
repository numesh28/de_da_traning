#9-1. Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for
#Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type.
#Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of
#information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating
#that the restaurant is open.
#Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attributes
#individually, and then call both methods.

class Restaurant:
    def __init__(self, restaurant_name, cuisine_type):
        # Initialize the name and cuisine type of the restaurant
        self.restaurant_name = restaurant_name
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        # Print the restaurant's name and cuisine type
        print(f"Restaurant Name: {self.restaurant_name}")
        print(f"Cuisine Type: {self.cuisine_type}")

    def open_restaurant(self):
        # Print a message indicating the restaurant is open
        print(f"{self.restaurant_name} is now open!")

# Creating an instance of the Restaurant class
restaurant = Restaurant("The Spice Garden", "Indian")

# Printing the attributes individually
print(restaurant.restaurant_name)
print(restaurant.cuisine_type)

# Calling the methods
restaurant.describe_restaurant()
